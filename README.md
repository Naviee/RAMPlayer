RAMPlayer
=========

Simple Videoplayer plugin for Cinema 4D

This code is a bit old (written back when C4D 11.5 was the latest version) 
but it may be helpful for beginners and uses these SDK features:
- BrowseFiles
- MovieSaver
- User Area
- CommandData
- Non-modal dialog with resources

As well as these features: 
- STL vector array

The code here should work fine with R13 and higher.

Feel free to commit and improve.

Navi√© releases this code into the public domain in hope that it is useful.
Let us know if you used it (it's not necessary, just nice to see..).
