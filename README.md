RAMPlayer
=========

Simple Videoplayer plugin for Cinema 4D

This code is a very old (written back in 2008 when C4D 11 was the latest version) and syntax wise
should not be used as an example of good programming but it may be helpful for beginners as it uses these SDK features:
- BrowseFiles
- MovieSaver
- User Area
- CommandData
- Non-modal dialog with resources

As well as these features: 
- STL vector array

The code here should work fine with R13 and higher.

Feel free to commit and improve.

Navi√© releases this code into the public domain in hope that it is useful.
