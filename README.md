RAMPlayer
=========

Simple Videoplayer plugin for Cinema 4D

This code is a bit old (written back when C4D 11.5 was the latest version) 
but it may be helpful for beginners and uses these SDK features:
- BrowseFiles
- MovieSaver
- STL vector array
- User Area
- CommandData
- Hard-Coded non-modal dialog

This was not checked to compile in any higher version of C4D 
but it should really only be small modifications if at all to make it compatible.

Feel free to commit and improve.

Navi√© releases this code into the public domain in hope that it is useful.
Feel free to credit us if you use the code, but it's not a necessity.
